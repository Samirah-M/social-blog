# To Do OList

## Frontend

make frontend access to backend look good
X    and make it output to a repeatable block standard
X add inputs for adding and updating
after auth
    only allow updating and deleting your own posts
X    your posts page
add error messages for, like, everything
    will require error testing and will probably reveal more bugs

## Backend

X add users and normalise database as needed
X add authentification of users
X    requires auth tokens, db relations
X    signup, login pages
